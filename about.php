      <h2>About The Mark Hotel</h2>
      <p>
        Located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, The Mark Hotel combines historic elegance with modern luxury. Originally built in 1927, this iconic building was redesigned by the acclaimed Jacques Grange in 2009, offering a unique experience for every guest.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the luxurious Jean-Georges restaurant to exclusive services like a bespoke fragrance by Frédéric Malle, The Mark Hotel redefines sophistication. Our Penthouse Suite, the largest in the United States, offers unparalleled luxury and breathtaking views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline.
      </p>
      <p>
        With its signature amenities, celebrity appeal, and a reputation as the unofficial red carpet of the Met Gala, The Mark is more than a hotel – it's a destination.
